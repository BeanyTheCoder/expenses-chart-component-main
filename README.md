## Overview 🌟

### The Challenge 🧪

Users should be able to:

- ✅ View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day

  - _Currently, chart.js does not support customizable tooltips(atleast that I am aware of) so I am simply using their own in-built tooltips, meaning it does not match the design_

- ✅ See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- ✅ View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- ✅ See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- ✅ **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart
